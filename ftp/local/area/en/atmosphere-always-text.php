Guests, impressed by the historic sights of Saint-Petersburg, will be welcomed by the friendly staff of our hotel. The administrators will not only help with check-in & out, but will always be in touch and will not leave any request without attention. We will help you to get to the hotel, call a taxi, or simply share interesting stories about our city over a cup of tea, which guests can enjoy on the ground floor in the lobby of our hotel.
