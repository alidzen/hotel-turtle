	Hotel "Akhilles i Cherepakha" is located in the historic center of St. Petersburg, that is full of history and
	legends. Dostoevsky street is one of the quietest places in the central area and it runs from the Our Lady of
	Vladimir Church that was built to Pietro Antonio Trezzini designs from 1761-1769. The church can be seen out of the
	windows of the Fyodor Dostoevskyâ€™s flat where the author's last work - the novel "Bratia Karamazovi" was written.
	Nowadays, in this building you can find the museum dedicated to the famous Russian novelist, Dostoyevsky.
