<p>The interior of the restaurant complex will be made in a classic style, complemented with loft elements. Brick walls
	on the ground floor where the café and gastronomy will take place will be colored into different colors as well as
	bright Viennese chairs.</p>
<p>The restaurant is located on the two top floors that have their own features and interesting details: columns,
	fireplaces, and ceiling paintings. A diversity of books on shelves, frescoes on the walls, décor out of antique
	busts, as well as various tiles on the floor with images of ancient churches will perfectly supplement the
	atmosphere. </p>
